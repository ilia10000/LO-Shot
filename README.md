[Paper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08449)

Explore the decision landscapes generated by soft-label k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers in the 'less than one'-shot learning setting.
This code is associated with the paper ['Less Than One'-Shot Learning: Learn N Classes from M<N Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08449)
Appearing soon in the AAAI-2021 main-track proceedings.

Online demo can be found on Binder (click "launch binder" above).

To run code offline, download the directory and run the `soft_knn_vis.ipynb` notebook
